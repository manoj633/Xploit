# Xploit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.9.

You are a famous hacker who has access to a list of the world's most famous celebrities.
You have to create a system where you can view and edit their details to hide their public presence.

Your mission if you choose to accept it, you have to:

1. Create the user interface provided with the design provided

2. The user list item is an accordion,

   - when clicked on, it will cause all the other accordions to collapse and enlarge the one which was clicked.
   - If clicked on the same one it will collapse.
   - Manage the + and - icons in open or collapsed mode (collapsed = - | open = +)

3. Fetch the JSON file provided to fill the list of users. (NOTE - YOU CANNOT EDIT THE JSON FILE)

   - You have to calculate the age of the user based on the date of birth provided
   - gender should be a dropdown (Male | Female | Transgender | Rather not say | Other)
   - country is a text field
   - Description is a text area

4. Provide buttons to edit or delete

   - edit mode will let you edit the details of the user in the exact place
   - you can only edit the user if the user is an adult
   - validations to be implemented where a user cannot
     -- input text in the age field
     -- input numbers in the nationality
     -- keep anything empty
   - when in edit mode you can either save or cancel
     -- save button will be disabled by default and will enable only if the details have changed
     -- save click will update the user's details
     -- cancel will revert the details to their last known state
     -- you cannot open another accordion while in edit mode
   - delete mode should alert you if you actually want to delete the user
     -- if yes - the user will be deleted
     -- if no - do nothing

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
